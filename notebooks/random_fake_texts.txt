text="Michelle Obama reflects on pressure she felt in '08 Speaking at Tuskegee University in Alabama, Obama told the audience that when her husband was running for office in 2008, she faced questions which she said were not typical for other candidates' wives.

"As potentially the first African-American first lady, I was also the focus of another set of questions and speculations, conversations sometimes rooted in the fears and misperceptions of others," she told the class of 2015. "Was I too loud or too emasculating? Or was I too soft? Too much of a mom and not enough of a career woman?"

Obama referenced the cover of the July 2008 issue of The New Yorker, in which Obama was depicted with her husband as terrorist enemies of the United States.

"Then there was the first time I was on a magazine cover. It was a cartoon drawing of me with a huge afro and a machine gun. Now, yeah, it was satire, but if I'm really being honest, it knocked me back a bit. It made me wonder 'just how are people seeing me?'"

In her nearly 30-minute speech, the first lady recalled other particularly tough moments, including being referred to on Fox News as her "husband's crony of color" and "Obama's baby mama." She also recalled a moment on the campaign trail when she gave her husband a fist bump to celebrate a primary win, later to be referred to by an anchor on that network as a "terrorist fist jab." "Back in those days, I had a lot of sleepless nights worrying what people thought of me," she recalled. Obama added that she let the criticism get to the point where she would wonder if she was hurting her husband's chances of becoming President, while also fearing what her daughters would think. The first lady said eventually the only thing she could do to prevent others from defining her was to "ignore all of the noise." "I had to be true to myself and the rest would work itself out," she recounted, to cheers from the audience. Obama also said that once she became first lady and was working on platforms and issues that were important to her she was once again criticized for her choices not "being bold enough." "So I immersed myself in the policy details. I worked with Congress on legislation, gave speeches to CEOs, military generals and Hollywood executives." Obama said. "But I also worked to ensure that my efforts would resonate with kids and families -- and that meant doing things in a creative and unconventional way. So, yeah, I planted a garden, and hula-hooped on the White House lawn with kids. I did some mom dancing on TV ... And at the end of the day, by staying true to the me I've always known, I found that this journey has been incredibly freeing." – In 2010, first lady Michelle Obama started Let's Move!, an initiative to address childhood obesity and help all our kids grow up healthy. Here she participates in musical activities with students in an event at Orr Elementary School in Washington in 2013. – The theme for the fifth year anniversary of Let's Move! is: Celebrate, challenge, champion.

Here kids attend a Let's Move! event at Woldenberg Park in New Orleans in 2010. 

 – Through the initiative, millions of kids are attending healthier day care centers, where fruits and vegetables have replaced cookies and juice. Michelle Obama speaks at a Let's Move! Walmart announcement at The Arc in Washington in 2010. – Nearly 9 million kids participate in the Let's Move! Active Schools program and get 60 minutes of physical activity a day. Nearly 5 million kids will be attending healthier after-school programs in the next five years. The first lady meets with students in New Hampshire Estates Elementary School in Silver Spring, Maryland, in 2010. 

 – The first lady speaks about Let's Move! at the Visitors Center in Red Rock Canyon, Nevada, in 2010. – Childhood obesity rates have finally stopped rising -- and obesity rates are actually falling among our youngest children, according to Let's Move! initiative. The first lady attends the White House Kitchen Garden harvest on the South Lawn in 2010. – While Let's Move! has made strides in helping kids become healthy, the statistics are still daunting. Here she attends a partnership event with Chicago Blackhawks and Washington Capitals players on the South Lawn of the White House in 2011. – First lady Michelle Obama and Ellen DeGeneres dance during a taping of "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" marking the second anniversary of Let's Move! in Burbank, California, in 2012. – America still spends nearly $200 billion a year on obesity-related health care costs, and that figure will jump to nearly $350 billion a year by 2018, according to Let's Move! campaign. Michelle Obama visits the Fresh Grocer store in Philadelphia in 2010. – The first lady attends a chef's demonstration with third-grade students from Pocantico Hill School and John F.

Here she works with chefs and students in the White House Kitchen Garden on the South Lawn in 2010. Obama added that she has since learned to focus on her "own truth," and suggested that the graduates of Tuskegee University, a historically black university, will have to do the same in life. She told the graduates they would face hardships in the future, warning that no matter how hard the students work or where they rise to in life, for some people it won't be enough. Obama said this is the fuel for much of the unrest across communities in America, making a reference to some of the racial controversies being played out in several American cities. "All of that is gonna be a heavy burden to carry. It can feel isolating. It can make you feel like your life somehow doesn't matter ... And as we've seen over the past few years, those feelings are real. They're rooted in decades of structural challenges that have made too many folks feel frustrated and invisible, and those feelings are playing out in communities like Baltimore and Ferguson and so many others across this country," Obama said. The first lady concluded by saying that while those feelings are real, they are never an excuse for the graduates to give up or lose hope but instead provide a better example of how to succeed. "It teaches us that when we pull ourselves out of the emotional depths and we challenge our frustrations into studying and organizing and banding together, then we can build ourselves and our communities up," she said. "We can take on those deep rooted problems, and together, together we can overcome anything."

text="Cecile Richards Credits Planned Parenthood Supporters with Stopping AHCA - Breitbart Immediately after the cancellation of the House vote on the American Health Care Act (AHCA) Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards sent out a fundraising email to her supporters, crediting them with stopping the vote on the bill. [“Paul Ryan and Donald Trump tried forcing through the worst legislation for women in a generation,” Richards says. “They were   on stripping health care from 24 million people, cutting essentials like maternity care, and blocking women from getting care at Planned Parenthood health centers. ”  Because people organized and spoke out, tomorrow 8, 118 people will be able to get care at Planned Parenthood health centers across America.  —   Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) March 24, 2017,  Great to have so many women’s health experts around the table discussing ending maternity coverage  blocking access to Planned Parenthood. pic. twitter.   —   Cecile Richards (@CecileRichards) March 23, 2017,  For awhile, Planned Parenthood was touting its “prenatal services. ” Once it was realized what these services were  —   for the most part, “fake news”  —   the abortion chain began boasting about its “maternity care,” largely to justify its more than half a billion dollars annually in taxpayer funding.  “The reality is, Planned Parenthood does zero mammograms, performs less than two percent of women’s cancer screenings in the U. S. offers virtually no prenatal care, yet does over a third of the nation’s abortions  —   887 abortions every day,” says Lila Rose, president of national   group Live Action. Rose’s organization recently released another investigative video in which Planned Parenthood staff members throughout the country are repeatedly heard informing the investigator that their clinics do not offer “prenatal care. ” “Live Action’s recent investigation has shown that women wanting to keep their children who were seeking prenatal care at Planned Parenthoods across the country were consistently turned away, despite Planned Parenthood’s claims that its federal funding goes toward prenatal care,” Rose says. “When subsequently asked, the abortion chain has refused to tell the media how many of its centers actually provide prenatal care. ” In her email message, Richards says to her supporters, “Your strength was far greater than theirs. The unprecedented grassroots energy from you and the entire Planned Parenthood community helped stop this bill from even leaving the House. ” “The incredible support of the Planned Parenthood community just made all the difference in stopping this dangerous bill right now,” she adds. “Our voices together are loud enough to drown out the   politicians  —   and we’ll need you with us for whatever comes next. ”"

text="With Gas Station’s Closing, a Fuel Desert Expands in Manhattan - The New York Times The gas station at the corner of Lafayette and East Houston Streets in SoHo is an industrial outpost in a Manhattan neighborhood of luxury lofts and even more luxurious shopping. It has existed on the corner for decades  —   first as Gaseteria, later as BP, but nearly always selling gas. For cabdrivers, it was a way station in an unruly city, where they could fill up, use the restroom, or kneel for afternoon prayers on one of the communal kilims the owner let them keep stowed beside the convenience mart. It closed on Thursday, to be replaced by a    luxury office building, turning some four square miles at the southern end of the borough into a gasoline desert. Today, the only reminder that this stretch of SoHo was once a forest of filling stations known as Gasoline Alley is a coffee shop of the same name that sells   coffee beans from Burundi. The closing of the inelegant station, its shabby convenience store invariably full of drivers dancing in place while waiting in line for the restroom, has a familiar feeling. As New York City’s molten property values have made selling off a parcel of land often more profitable than operating the grocery, hardware store or gas station sitting on it, the gas station’s passing appears to be the latest example of a common trope. And while Amazon and FreshDirect may fill the hole when the corner store goes condo, there is no doubt it is getting harder in Manhattan to get many of the basics that make life livable. What happens now if you are downtown and the needle is on E? “It’s not going to be easy for the drivers, and the people who are using this facility,” Sunkanmi Alaka, a cabdriver, said as he waited for the restroom a few days before the station closed. “You’re going to travel miles before you see a gas station. ” Today there is not a single operating gas station left on the city’s East Side from the southern tip of the island to 23rd Street, a chunk of Manhattan that includes some of the most highly trafficked portions of the city, like the   transverses between the bridges to the east and Holland Tunnel to the west, and the   corridors of Wall Street and NoHo. With the exception of a small station in the West Village, the West Side is similarly parched. In Manhattan, there are 50 gas stations that can be used by the public, according to the Fire Department. Over the past eight years, about 30 have disappeared. A 2014 analysis by The Wall Street Journal said there were just 12 below 96th Street, but several have closed since then. The math makes the decision to pack up shop and build simple. “If you own the gas station and you own the land, and you can get 30 or 40 million dollars for that, you could run that gas station for 100 years and never make that kind of money,” said Ralph Bombardiere, executive director of the New York State Association of Service Stations and Repair Shops, which lobbies on behalf of the industry in New York. The gas station that closed Thursday was owned by Marcello Porcelli, whose father bought the corner plot for $100, 000 about four decades ago and built up the Gaseteria brand, whose    signs became a fixture of the city’s 1970s streetscape. In the early 2000s his father’s company, LargaVista, shifted its goals to prioritize developing its more than 60 parcels citywide, “in order to maximize its extremely valuable portfolio of prime locations,” according to its website. LargaVista has formed a partnership with Related, a development company, to build the office building, a   $200 million project of zigzagging glass designed by the architect Rick Cook. “Everyone is nostalgic when you look at something that’s been there for a while, maybe even a gas station,” said Lisa Linden, a spokeswoman for LargaVista, which is Spanish for “long view. ” “There are many things that people need, the question is, Is this location going forward?” she added. The building will bring jobs to the city, Ms. Linden said, adding: “Cabdrivers will be dropping people off there. So. ” For many, the closing is a nonissue, including those who rely on the subway system or believe New York is still too  . Many neighbors are happy to see the station, which they see as an eyesore, go, including members of Community Board 2, which approved the new building. Board members did not respond to requests for an interview. Woolworth’s and the Gristedes supermarket chain are among the   businesses that have sold as the value of their land has eclipsed profits. But while disappearing grocery stores have provoked public outcry and even street demonstrations, the loss of one charmless gas station  —   even if it is the last one for miles  —   seems to induce little clamor beyond the cabdriver community. Maqsood Ahmad, 49, a former cabdriver who owns Little Lahore, a restaurant on Crosby Street next to the gas station that has sold Pakistani cuisine to a mostly cabby clientele for two decades, believes gas stations have evaporated unchecked in part because their most loyal clients are   immigrants who often feel voiceless. The city, he said, needs “the lower people,   people and   people. ” “They need all the mix,” he added. “But right now they are running on the path that they need only money. ” Mr. Ahmad’s rent for his    subterranean restaurant has risen from $1, 100, when he started in 1995, to $10, 000 a month today. He will have to close, he believes, when the cabs no longer have a pit stop. Gas station attrition is widespread. A decade ago, there were nearly 300, 000 gas stations nationwide there are now fewer than 140, 000, according to Michael J. Fox, the executive director of the Gasoline and Automotive Service Dealers of America, the industry association for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Consolidation is partly responsible for the decline, as are new environmental regulations that make updating underground gas reservoirs a burdensome expense, he said, but in increasingly expensive cities, like New Canaan and Greenwich, in Connecticut, and San Francisco, booming real estate values are most often to blame. Mr. Fox’s organization has fought for states to pass laws, or to add tax incentives for stations that stay, that might thwart the decline. “The Manhattan circumstance is going to keep spreading,” he said. “I remember one time when Brooklyn was considered the garbage dump, now Brooklyn is the new Manhattan. You want to get the law passed so that it doesn’t come to be that within a   radius you have no service stations at all because of the real estate situation. ” The mood at the gas station a few days before its closing was bitter. “I worry about my mayor: Where is his driver going to fill up the gas?” Janusz Krawczynski, 65, said as he sat in his cab in the station’s lot, his voice loaded with sarcasm. “Right now, any place he goes, he’s late,” he said, referring to the mayor’s   history of tardiness. “The driver is going to have to go to fill up the gas in New Jersey, Brooklyn, the Bronx,” he said. “He’ll never go to a meeting!” Not all see that vision as bad. In the West Village, where Athanasios Hondros, who goes by Tommy, runs a   Mobil station, business has been booming, and though people have come with envelopes of cash, he said, the station is not for sale. “Doesn’t bother me,” he said. “I plan on being the last gas station left. ”"

text="U.S. wants stronger India economic, defense ties given China's rise: Tillerson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said before a visit to India next week that the Trump administration wanted to  dramatically deepen  cooperation with New Delhi, seeing it as a key partner in the face of negative Chinese influence in Asia. Speaking on Wednesday, less than a month before President Donald Trump is due to make his first state visit to China, Tillerson said the United States had begun to discuss creating alternatives to Chinese infrastructure financing in Asia. In another comment likely to upset Beijing, he said Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation, something Beijing has opposed as an attempt by democracies to gang up on it. The remarks coincide with the start of a week-long Chinese Communist Party congress at which President Xi Jinping is seeking to further consolidate his power.  The United States seeks constructive relations with China, but we will not shrink from China s challenges to the rules-based order and where China subverts the sovereignty of neighboring countries and disadvantages the U.S. and our friends,  Tillerson told the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.  India and the United States should be in the business of equipping other countries to defend their sovereignty, build greater connectivity, and have a louder voice in a regional architecture that promotes their interests and develops their economies,  Tillerson added. The U.S. decision to expand relations with India almost certainly will upset India s rival, Pakistan, where Tillerson also will stop next week, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity. Pakistan was the main U.S. ally in South Asia for decades, but U.S. officials are frustrated with what they charge has been Pakistan s failure to cut support for the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, where the administration wants India to play a bigger role in economic development. As part of a South Asia strategy unveiled by Trump in August, Tillerson is expected to press Islamabad, which denies aiding the Taliban, to take stronger steps against extremists and allied groups and intensify efforts to pressure them to agree to peace talks with Kabul.  We expect Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorist groups based there that threaten its own people and the broader region,  Tillerson said. Trump has threatened further cuts in U.S. aid to Pakistan if it fails to cooperate. China, a strategic rival to the United States and India, is also vital to Trump s efforts to roll back North Korea s efforts to create nuclear-armed missiles capable of reaching the United States, an issue expected to top the agenda in Trump s Nov. 8-10 Beijing visit. A senior State Department official defended the timing of the speech, saying Tillerson also said he wanted a constructive relationship with China.  For many decades the United States has supported China s rise,  said the official.  We ve also supported India s rise. But those two countries have risen very differently.  In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China hoped the United States could abandon bias when viewing its actions overseas.  China will never develop itself at the expense of other countries,  Lu told a regular briefing on Thursday.  At the same time we will never give up our justly deserved rights and interests.   Healthy relations between China and the United States are good for the people of both countries and are expected by the Asia-Pacific region, he added. Tillerson did not say what he meant by creating an alternative to Chinese infrastructure financing, but said the Trump administration had begun a  quiet conversation  with some emerging East Asian democracies at a summit in August. He said Chinese financing was saddling countries with  enormous  debts and failing to create jobs.  We think it s important that we begin to develop some means of countering that with alternative financing measures.   We will not be able to compete with the kind of terms that China offers, but countries have to decide what are they willing to pay to secure their sovereignty and their future control of their economies and we ve had those discussions with them as well,  he said.

text="SpaceX Says It’s Ready to Launch Rockets Again - The New York Times After the explosion in September of one of its rockets, SpaceX is now ready to get back into the business of sending payloads to space, the company announced on Monday, with its next rocket headed to orbit as soon as Sunday. In a statement, SpaceX  —   or more formally, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation  —   said that an investigation had determined the likely cause: an unexpected interplay of supercold helium and oxygen with carbon fibers and aluminum. The statement Monday added technical details about what went wrong, and the company said it had devised workarounds to prevent a recurrence. The cascade of explosions on Sept. 1 that destroyed a Falcon 9 rocket on the launchpad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida was perplexing and concerning, because it occurred during what is usually regarded as a safer portion of operations  —   the fueling of propellants  —   about eight minutes before the ignition of the engines for a planned test. (The launch had been scheduled for two days later.) The trouble appeared to start near the liquid oxygen tank on the second stage of the   rocket, and in less than a tenth of a second, that section was in flames, followed by the destruction of the entire rocket and a $200 million communications satellite whose customers included Facebook, which had planned to use it to expand internet services in Africa. Under current federal laws, investigations into such explosions are led by the company that built the rocket, not by a government agency. The investigation panel included representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration, the United States Air Force, NASA and the National Transportation Safety Board. Falcon 9 rockets are used to carry NASA cargo to the International Space Station and are to provide transportation for astronauts beginning in 2018. SpaceX is also competing to win contracts to launch Department of Defense spy satellites. With few obvious clues to the explosion, the company initially considered hypotheses like sabotage, that a sniper had fired a shot rupturing the oxygen tank from the roof of a competitor’s building nearby. “The accident investigation team worked systematically through an extensive fault tree analysis,” SpaceX said in its statement. The investigation narrowed in on three helium containers within the   liquid oxygen tank. The containers consist of an aluminum liner with an outer layer of strong carbon fibers. During launch, as the liquid oxygen is consumed, the helium is heated and released to maintain pressure within the tank. In December 2015, SpaceX began using an upgraded Falcon 9 design that uses supercooled liquid oxygen at minus 340 degrees, 40 degrees colder than what is typically used. The lower temperature makes the oxygen denser, which improves engine thrust. But the helium was even colder. As the carbon and aluminum cool, they shrink at different rates, opening gaps into which liquid oxygen could flow. In addition, the helium may have been below the temperature at which oxygen freezes, and some of the trapped oxygen may have become solid. “Really surprising problem that’s never been encountered before in the history of rocketry,” Elon Musk, the chief executive of SpaceX, said in an interview on CNBC in November. Both carbon and aluminum can burn, and with oxygen sandwiched in between, all of the ingredients for a conflagration were present. Friction or the breaking of fibers could have provided the energy for ignition, the company said. Tests at SpaceX’s facilities in Hawthorne, Calif. and McGregor, Tex. supported that conclusion, the company said. The configuration of the helium containers has been shifted, and the fueling procedures will change so that the helium will be warmer, SpaceX said. The next SpaceX launch is to carry a   of satellites for Iridium Communications, which provides communications services including satellite telephones through a constellation of satellites. Iridium is looking to replace the surviving 65 original satellites with 70 new satellites, each about the size of a Mini Cooper car. A month ago, Iridium issued a statement saying it hoped that SpaceX would be able to launch its satellites in   but less than a week later, SpaceX said it was pushing back the launch date to early January. The Iridium satellite is to be launched by SpaceX from a leased launchpad at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. For launches from Florida, SpaceX hopes to complete renovations at Launchpad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center, once used for space shuttle launches. SpaceX is tentatively aiming to resume cargo flights to the space station this month."

text="Pakistan appoints economist to head finance ministry in run-up to election Karachi, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan has appointed an economist, who was recently chairman of the board of investment, to take charge of the finance ministry after the former minister was relieved of his duties amid accusations of corruption. Miftah Ismail has been made an adviser to the prime minister for finance, with the status of a federal minister, the government said in a notification.  Although I will have stewardship of the Ministry of Finance for only 5 months, the prime minister has tasked me to help him implement a very ambitious agenda,  Ismail said in a post on Twitter. He was referring to general election due next year and widely expected in May, though no date has been fixed. The former fiance minister, Ishaq Dar, was relieved of his portfolio on Nov. 22 amid mounting headwinds for the $300 billion economy battling to stave off balance of payments pressures due to dwindling foreign currency reserves and a widening current account deficit. Dar, who was widely credited with navigating Pakistan out of a 2013 balance of payments crisis, is facing corruption charges in connection with accusations he amassed wealth beyond his known sources of income. Dar has denied all charges. He is receiving treatment in London for a heart condition. Ismail is a member of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif s political party, which is still the ruling party even though Sharif was ousted amid corruption allegations in July.  Sharif has also denied any wrongdoing. The party has been reluctant to allow the rupee to weaken ahead of elections as it may stoke inflation, though many investors and economists say a weaker rupee is needed to shore up lagging exports. Samiullah Tariq, director of research at Arif Habib Limited, said he expected Ismail would let the rupee soften if he though it necessary.  Basically, he s pro-business, if he feels that a stronger rupee is hindering exports, he will let it weaken,  Tariq told Reuters.  He has plans to introduce tax reforms, rationalize tax rates, create a scheme to release refunds and initiate a scheme to bring back and declare foreign assets owned by Pakistanis,   Tariq added.  "

text="Take cover, avoid bomb flash. Guam issues nuclear guidelines WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Guam posted emergency guidelines on Friday to help residents prepare for any potential nuclear attack after a threat from North Korea to fire missiles in the vicinity of the U.S. Pacific territory. Pyongyang’s state-run KCNA news agency said on Thursday its army would complete plans in mid-August to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near Guam as North Korea and the United States engaged in increasingly heated rhetoric this week over the North’s nuclear weapons program.  North Korea did not threaten Guam with a nuclear attack, but the crisis between Pyongyang and the United States has stirred fears that a nuclear conflict could break out in the region. While the governor of Guam shrugged off the North’s missile warning and said there was no heightened threat, the government has issued a preparedness fact sheet. In language that evoked the specter of nuclear conflict during the Cold War, the guidelines cover what to do before, during and after a nuclear attack.  “Do not look at the flash or fireball – It can blind you,” it said. “Take cover behind anything that might offer protection.”  “Remove your clothing to keep radioactive material from spreading. Removing the outer layer of clothing can remove up to 90% of radioactive material,” read the guidelines of what to do if caught outside.  They suggest having an emergency plan and supply kit and making a list of potential concrete structures near home, work and school to serve as fallout shelters. “Fallout shelters do not need to be specifically constructed for protecting against fallout,” it said. “They can be protected space, provided that the walls and roof are thick and dense enough (i.e. concrete) to absorb radiation given off by fallout particles.” The fact sheet advises people on how to wash: do not scrub or scratch the skin, use soap, shampoo and water but do not put not conditioner on your hair because it binds radioactive material. It offers advice for parents who are away from their children during a strike.  “Stay where you are, even if you are separated from your family,” it said. “Listen to the news. Do not call the school. Be patient. Wait for instructions to pick up your child.” The information on the fact sheet was gathered from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security website www.ready.gov, a Guam Homeland Security spokeswoman told the Pacific Daily News. Guam is home to about 163,000 people and a U.S. military base that includes a submarine squadron, an air base and a Coast Guard group. (For a graphic on North Korean missile trajectories, ranges click tmsnrt.rs/2hIzZHG)  U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday warned North Korea against threatening Guam and said on Friday that the U.S. military was “locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely.” Asked about Trump’s tough posture, Guam Governor Eddie Calvo said he agreed with sending a clear message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who has ramped up his country’s tests of missiles and nuclear bombs. “Though I don’t want the temperature to get any higher, I think it’s important also that there is clarity and that if there is an attack on any American soil including Guam, that it will be met with overwhelming response,” Calvo told reporters on Friday. “I don’t have any problem with that.”         (The story was refiled to fix the graphic link in paragraph 14) "

text="FBI's Comey meets with top U.S. congressional leaders WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director James Comey on Thursday met with senior congressional leaders, including the intelligence committee chiefs, FBI and congressional officials said. The officials declined to discuss the subject of Comey’s meeting with the group of leaders known as the “Gang of Eight”. U.S. President Donald Trump has alleged that the Obama administration wiretapped his election campaign. The Gang of Eight, who have routine access to highly classified materials, include House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes and its top Democrat, Adam Schiff. Senate members include Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the top Republican and Democrat on the intelligence committee, Senators Richard Burr and Mark Warner. The House intelligence committee on Wednesday asked the Justice Department in a letter for copies of documents which if they exist could shed light on Trump’s allegation. A law enforcement source said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was in discussions with the National Security Division of the Justice Department as to how to respond to public and congressional inquiries about the existence or non-existence of such eavesdropping. If Trump’s campaign or advisers were indeed being wiretapped, the most likely legal path for the Obama administration to do so would be to have the Justice Department ask the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for permission to eavesdrop. Trump accused predecessor Barack Obama on Saturday of wiretapping him during the late stages of the campaign, but offered no evidence for an allegation which an Obama spokesman said was “simply false”. The intelligence committee’s letter, addressed to Dana Boente, the acting Deputy U.S. Attorney General, also asks for copies of any such orders actually issued by the court and any electronic surveillance warrants related to Trump or his associates issued last year by a federal judge or magistrate under a wide-ranging anti-crime law. Reuters saw a copy of the letter, signed by Nunes and Schiff, on Thursday. The letter has not been publicly released. Nunes said on Tuesday he had seen no evidence to support Trump’s wiretapping allegation. Law enforcement sources have said that the FBI is pursuing a wide-ranging counter-intelligence investigation of alleged contacts between Trump associates and Russians, as well as two separate investigations into pre-election email hacking linked to Russia which mainly targeted Democratic political operatives.

text="Ukraine - biggest obstacle to normal Russia ties, says Tillerson VIENNA (Reuters) - The United States would  badly  like to lift sanctions against Russia but will not do so until Moscow has pulled its forces out of eastern Ukraine and Crimea, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday, calling that the main obstacle to normal ties. Tillerson is on a visit to Europe during which he has reassured allies with tougher rhetoric against Moscow than that of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has sought better relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), also attended by his Russian counterpart, Tillerson said Moscow was to blame for increased violence in eastern Ukraine and that had to stop.  We ve made this clear to Russia from the very beginning, that we must address Ukraine,  Tillerson told a news conference with his Austrian counterpart Sebastian Kurz.  It stands as the single most difficult obstacle to us renormalizing the relationship with Russia, which we badly would like to do.  On Wednesday, Tillerson met NATO foreign ministers and criticized Russia for the mix of state-sponsored computer hacks and Internet disinformation campaigns that NATO allies  intelligence agencies say is targeted at the West. The conflict between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine has claimed more than 10,000 lives since it erupted in 2014. Russia denies accusations that it fomented the conflict and provided arms and fighters. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the OSCE conference that  all the responsibility is with Ukraine  as far as violence in the east was concerned. In his speech to the gathering, Tillerson went even further in spelling out Russia s involvement in the conflict and the consequences it faced than he had the day before in Brussels.   We should be clear about the source of this violence,  Tillerson said, referring to increasing ceasefire violations recorded by OSCE monitors in eastern Ukraine.  Russia is arming, leading, training and fighting alongside anti-government forces. We call on Russia and its proxies to end its harassment, intimidation and its attacks on the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission.  While both sides have called for a U.N. peacekeeping force in eastern Ukraine, they disagree on the terms of its deployment, and there was little sign of concrete progress at Thursday s meeting.  We will continue to work with Russia to see if we could not agree a peacekeeping force that could enter Ukraine (and) reduce the violence,  Tillerson told the news conference. He and Lavrov met on the sidelines of the conference, though both ignored reporters  questions when the meeting began. Asked later what commitments he had received at the meeting, Tillerson said:  I m not going to tell you specifically what we get. We get progress, that s what we get. We get dialogue, we get cooperation, we don t have it solved. You don t solve it in one meeting.   In his speech, he referred to the 2015 Minsk ceasefire agreement, brokered in the Belarussian capital by France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.  In eastern Ukraine, we join our European partners in maintaining sanctions until Russia withdraws its forces from the Donbass (region) and meets its Minsk commitments,  Tillerson said. He also made clear that Washington did not accept Russia s seizure of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.  We will never accept Russia s occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea. Crimea-related sanctions will remain in place until Russia returns full control of the peninsula to Ukraine,  he said. "

text="Gupta emails still under investigation: top South Africa prosecutor CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa s top prosecutor said police were still examining a trove of leaked documents detailing relations between the wealthy Gupta family and President Jacob Zuma, but it was too early to say if a prosecution should be launched. Wednesday s comments to lawmakers by Shaun Abrahams were the first time the head of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has spoken publicly about the Gupta case.  The leaked emails need to be investigated,  Abrahams told a parliamentary committee in response to a question on whether his department had taken a position on the matter.  How can you make a determination on its admissibility if that (police) investigation is still ongoing? , he said. The elite  Hawks  police unit, which probes organized and commercial crime and major corruption, is investigating the Gupta allegations, NPA officials told a parliamentary briefing. Under the South African system, police investigate a case and then send a report to the NPA, which decides whether to take the case further. Senior ANC members and the opposition accuse the brothers of using their relationship with Zuma to wield influence and win government contracts, allegations that in part stem from a trove of 100,000 documents and emails leaked to reporters. The Gupta family of Indian-born businessmen were not immediately available for comment on Abraham s remarks. The brothers, who own a computer business and uranium mine, have previously denied any wrongdoing. Atul Gupta, one of three Gupta brothers, said last month that the emails were fake. Zuma has also denied any wrongdoing but his relationship with the Guptas has deepened a divide within his ruling African National Congress ahead of a conference in December where Zuma s successor as party leader - and therefore president - will be chosen. Zuma survived a no-confidence motion in August. He can remain president until a 2019 election but some opposition politicians have demanded he resign over material in the leaked emails. "

The vessel, called Yantar (Amber), is equipped with two self-propelled deep submergence vehicles allowing it to examine underwater areas up to 6,000 meters (3.75 miles) deep, TASS quoted the Russian military as saying. Dozens of planes and boats are searching for the San Juan submarine. The search entered a  critical phase  on Wednesday as the 44 crew on board could be running low on oxygen, an Argentine navy spokesman said.

text="House Republican tax chief to huddle with Democrats WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Texas Republican spearheading tax reform efforts in the U.S. House of Representatives will meet with Democrats to discuss policy ideas, as Republicans try to secure a victory for President Donald Trump after his healthcare bill’s failure. House Ways and Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady said the meeting with his panel’s 16 Democratic members will focus on ways to simplify the U.S. tax code for individuals and stop U.S. companies from moving production and research facilities overseas - both key House Republican tax reform objectives.   “At the end of the day, I don’t want to make a prediction as to where that goes. But I think this engagement’s important,” Brady told reporters on Monday. “I’d love to have them bring their ideas on how we leapfrog America back into the lead as the most competitive place on earth for that new business.”  The meeting is expected to take place on Wednesday, according to House aides.  A spokesman for Ways and Means Democrats had no immediate comment.   Brady said the meeting has nothing to do with the healthcare debacle on March 24, when the Republican-controlled House pulled legislation to repeal and replace the healthcare law known as Obamacare when it became clear that Republicans would fall short of the votes needed. Trump blamed the failure on hardline Republican conservatives who opposed the bill and threatened to reach out to Democrats. But the Trump administration has signaled an interest in finding bipartisan support for tax reform legislation, billed as the first comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. tax code since 1986. The White House has also shown signs of moving away from the House tax reform blueprint backed by Brady and House Speaker Paul Ryan, informing Republican lawmakers on March 16 that all options were on the table.  The House blueprint, which Democrats oppose, calls for sweeping changes and tax cuts that would mainly benefit the wealthy. But it has divided the business community and Republicans over a border adjustment tax provision that would impose a 20 percent tax on imports while exempting export revenues from tax. White House officials told lawmakers last month that they were seriously considering other options, including deficit-funded tax cuts and a European-style value-added tax for businesses. Brady expects to unveil tax reform legislation this spring, with a full House vote as early as the summer.   "

text="May Day rally in Los Angeles features strong anti-Trump theme  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Hundreds of people marched through Los Angeles on Sunday in a May Day rally that took aim at Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump for his anti-illegal immigration platform that includes building a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. The demonstration in America’s second most populous city, which has a large immigrant population, came just days after protesters smashed the window of a police car and blocked traffic outside a Trump campaign event in Costa Mesa, California, 40 miles (64 km) southeast of Los Angeles. On Friday, demonstrators blocked the entrance of a hotel hosting the California Republican convention in Burlingame, south of San Francisco, forcing Trump to halt his motorcade and go through a back entrance to deliver his speech. The rally in Los Angeles remained peaceful and drew smaller crowds than some past May Day demonstrations in the city, with several hundred people marching through downtown at one point but largely dispersing by midafternoon.  Members of the crowd carried a large blow-up effigy of Trump holding a Ku Klux Klan hood, along with signs that read: “Dump Trump.”  “He’s threatened that should he become president of the United States, in his first 18 months in office, he fully intends to deport all 11 million-plus undocumented persons in the United States. We don’t take that lightly,” said Juan Jose Gutierrez, of the Full Rights for Immigrants Coalition. Others waved Mexican or U.S. flags or signs that called for immigration reform and an end to deportations. A Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman said no arrests were made and there were no reports of violence.  Protests have become common outside rallies for Trump, 69, the New York billionaire businessman. He has aroused criticism for his pledge to deport illegal immigrants, even as it helped propel him in the race for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. He has accused Mexico of sending drug dealers and rapists to the United States and has promised to build a wall along the southern border and make Mexico pay for it. Trump said on Sunday he will have essentially sealed the Republican nomination if he wins Tuesday’s contest in Indiana, where he holds a big lead over chief rival Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas. California holds its presidential primary on June 7.  "

text="In Ethiopia, Obama seeks progress on peace, security in East Africa ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia —President Obama convened a meeting with the leaders of several East African nations and the African Union on Monday in an effort to address the worsening situation in South Sudan, even as he met with Ethiopia’s prime minister to discuss how to strengthen human rights and democratic institutions here.

With no resolution in sight for the ongoing conflict in South Sudan, Obama brought together top officials from Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Sudan and the A.U. to chart out a strategy in the event that the latest round of peace talks fail.

African nations, led by Ethiopia, have been trying to broker a peace in South Sudan through the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), a regional body, and are almost ready to present a possible compromise to the warring parties. The two sides will have until Aug. 17 to respond to the proposal, but administration officials have little expectation that they will accept it.

On Monday, Obama praised the regional leaders for showing “extraordinary leadership in trying to address the continuing situation in South Sudan.” The group included Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, African Union Chairperson Dlamini Zuma and Sudan’s minister of foreign affairs, Ibrahim Ghandour.

“This gives me and the U.S. delegation an opportunity to learn from them what progress has been made, where there appears to be continued roadblocks and how we can partner with them to make progress,” Obama said. “Our hope is that we can actually bring about the kind of peace that the people of South Sudan so desperately need.”

The question of South Sudan — a nation that the United States helped bring into existence in 2011 after years of effort by both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations — has vexed American policymakers for years.

In December 2013, South Sudan President Salva Kiir accused Riek Machar, who had served as his vice president, of attempting a coup d’etat. The two had been longtime political rivals from different ethnic groups — Kiir is Dinka, Machar is a Nuer — who had come together to form a government when the country was first created.

While tribal differences have helped fuel the conflict, the war has been largely focused on control of the nation’s oil fields, South Sudan’s primary source of revenue.

Princeton Lyman, U.S. special envoy for Sudan and South Sudan from 2011 to 2013, noted that when he first took over as envoy, the United States had spent $10 billion on peacekeeping and other assistance for the two nations, “and that was four years ago… This is a big investment,” he added.

At this point, more than 2.5 million people are facing food shortages, while roughly 1.5 million are displaced from their homes. An additional 520,000 South Sudanese have fled across the border into neighboring countries, including Ethiopia.

The conflict also poses a major economic problem for Kenya, which had major investments in South Sudan before the fighting broke out. The LAPSSET Corridor project was aimed at transporting oil from South Sudan to the Kenyan port of Lamu, and according to E.J. Hogendoorn, deputy program director for Africa at the International Crisis Group, the planned transportation and infrastructure development could have been an “engine of development" for many parts of East Africa. "Unfortunately, of course, that’s on hold because of the war,” he said.

While Obama spent part of the afternoon addressing a regional conflict in Africa, he devoted the rest of the day to strengthening ties with Ethiopia, whose alliance with the United States dates back more than a century. But the current government has come under sharp criticism for its treatment of political opponents and journalists.

Obama is the first sitting U.S. president to visit Ethiopia.

In a news conference Monday afternoon, both Obama and Hailemariam said they had a frank discussion about Ethiopia's human rights practices and the need for improvement. Ethiopia is Africa’s number two jailer of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and its ruling party won 100 percent of the seats in May’s parliamentary elections.

White House national security adviser Susan Rice, asked last week whether she considered Ethiopia a democracy, replied, with irony: “One hundred percent.”

But during the news conference Obama twice referred to the Ethiopian government as “democratically elected.”

“I don’t bite my tongue,” Obama said of raising concerns on these issues with Ethiopia. “But I do so from a position of respect.”

Hailemariam, for his part, said, “Our commitment to democracy is real, not skin deep.”

But he added later that people could not expect sweeping reforms given the fact that military rule ended just a couple of decades ago. “Something has to be understood: This is a fledgling democracy.”

The two leaders also discussed their collaboration on counterterrorism, an area in which Ethiopia has been an active leader. The White House announced Monday it will “work with Congress to provide approximately $465 million” this year in new training, equipment and capacity-building aid to its African allies.

The administration also said it would provide at least $40 million in assistance this fiscal year to combat violent extremism in East Africa. The money is intended to foster collaboration among security forces, law enforcement, government officials, community leaders and members of civil society, officials said.

Obama praised Ethiopia’s work to curb extremist activity but noted that its government had labeled some opposition groups as posing a greater threat than U.S. intelligence would indicate. “Our intelligence indicates while they may oppose the government, they have not tipped into terrorism,” he said.

The United States provides more than $600 million in assistance to Ethiopia annually. The vast bulk of that — $490 million — comes from the U.S. Agency for International Development, while the rest is largely security-related. Last fiscal year, nearly $200 million went to health programs, while $163 million went to humanitarian aid.

Obama said Ethiopia “has proven itself a global leader” on development and over the past 15 years “has lifted millions of people out of poverty.”

“To many people around the world, their image of Ethiopia remains stuck in the past, remembering drought and famine,” he said.

The two leaders appeared to have a friendly rapport throughout the news conference. Hailemariam described his country as scoring a series of firsts: Along with being “the cradle of mankind,” he said, “Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee.” That elicited a smile from Obama.

Obama said he was impressed by the Ethiopian’s unusual pets. “I had a chance to see the famous lions that live on the grounds," he said. "I’m considering getting some for the White House.” But he conceded that before he did that, “I’ll have to make sure my dogs are safe.”"

text="Iraq court rules no region can secede after Kurdish independence bid BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq s Supreme Federal Court ruled on Monday that no region or province can secede, strengthening the government s hand as it seeks to prevent a repeat of September s Kurdish independence vote. The ruling was a response to a request from the central government in Baghdad to put an end to any  wrong misinterpretation  of the constitution and assert the unity of Iraq, a court spokesman said. Soon after, Iraqi PM Haider al-Abadi urged the northern semi-autonomous Kurdish region to abide by the court s decision.   We call on the region to clearly state its commitment to non-separation or independence from Iraq,  he said in a statement. There was no immediate reaction from Kurdish authorities. Iraq s Kurds voted overwhelmingly to break away from Iraq in a referendum held on Sept. 25, defying the central government in Baghdad as well as neighboring Turkey and Iran who have their own Kurdish minorities. Iraqi government forces and the Iran-backed Popular Mobilisation Forces launched a surprise offensive on Oct. 16 in retaliation. Government forces managed to wrest back control of the oil city of Kirkuk and other disputed territories. Abadi said the government was now  taking the necessary measures to impose federal authorities  without going into further details. Baghdad was committed to  preserving Iraq s unity and preventing any attempt for separation,  he added. The ruling would strengthen Abadi s hand in future dealings with the Kurds, said Ahmed Younis, a Baghdad-based constitutional expert.    The court ruling has put an end to the Kurdish attempt to breakaway from Iraq,  he added. The court is responsible for settling disputes between Iraq s central government and the country s regions and provinces, including Kurdistan. Its decisions are final and mandatory for all parties according to the constitution, however it has no mechanism to enforce its ruling in the Kurdish region. Earlier on Monday, the Kurdish region s Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani reiterated his call to resolve its issues with the central government through dialogue and not through force.  "

text="Trump and U.S. Chamber of Commerce Pull No Punches on Trade Policy - The New York Times In January, Thomas J. Donohue, the feisty chief executive of the U. S. Chamber of Commerce, noted  —   without naming names  —   that there were “loud voices” this election season who talked about walling off America from talent and trade. He called that position “morally wrong and politically stupid. ” In March, Mr. Donohue got a little more blunt. “Donald Trump has very little idea about what trade really is,” he told Bloomberg television. And recently, the gloves came off completely. As the presumptive Republican nominee gave a speech, threatening to rip up trade accords and put tariffs on goods from China, the chamber   its jabs and counterpunches. “Under Trump’s trade plans, we would see higher prices, fewer jobs, and a weaker economy,” read one tweet. Another tweet warned that the chamber’s analysis shows that Mr. Trump’s proposed tariffs “would strip us of at least 3. 5 million jobs. ” For the chamber, the bastion of free enterprise and free trade whose roots date back more than 100 years, Mr. Trump’s willingness to upend trade agreements, to tax goods from important countries and even invite a trade war is tantamount to rolling tanks up to its doors. The acrimonious relationship between the chamber and the presumptive Republican nominee is highly unusual: Historically, the two have been as close as peanut butter and jelly. “I’m pretty sure at this point, Trump is just dug in on immigration and trade and the chamber is just going to have to go past him, basically, try to make sure good policy gets recognized by members of the House and Senate,” said Douglas   who was the chief economist for John McCain’s presidential bid in 2008. Indeed, much of the chamber’s political push is now focused on Congress. The goal is to help Republican candidates who share its principles hold crucial congressional seats, no matter who wins the presidential race. The growing divide between Mr. Trump and myriad bulwarks of the conservative Republican Party comes as the party races toward its convention in Cleveland next week. The convention is typically the time when the party rallies behind its candidate and develops a set of common policy goals and proposals. “What are they going to do with the Republican platform? I have no idea,” said Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential run. Mr. Trump, with his swaggering,     campaign style, has shown time and again a willingness  —   nay, an eagerness  —   to thumb his nose at the   members of the Republican establishment, whether big donors like the Koch brothers or powerful entities like the U. S. Chamber of Commerce. “They’re a special interest that wants to have the deals that they want to have,” Mr. Trump said to cheers at a packed rally in Bangor, Me. the day after his trade speech. The chamber, he added, was “controlled totally by various groups of people that don’t care about you whatsoever. ” Mr. Trump’s isolationist trade policies play well to individuals who perceive the Republican establishment and their ilk have gotten rich from existing trade policies while their own jobs have moved to   countries like Mexico or China. “He’s running as a populist    candidate and there’s hardly a more important organization on the right side of Washington politics than the Chamber of Commerce,” said Richard L. Hall, a professor at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. “But I don’t think the Chamber of Commerce is going to sit silent when Trump is taking positions that run against some of their main themes. ” On its website, the chamber has started to post dire predictions of what a Trump presidency might mean. “Republican   Donald Trump has promised to ‘make America great again,’” began an article posted on the chamber’s website in April. “Does a recession sound ‘great’ to you? Do 7 million lost jobs sound like ‘winning’?” The chamber is no fan of Hillary Clinton’s policies, either. The Washington Post recently published an   by Mr. Donohue in which he said both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were wrong on trade. For much of its existence, the chamber acted as a trade association for American businesses, typically adopting   stances on deregulation of various industries, corporate tax rates and trade agreements. That changed when Mr. Donohue took over as the chamber president in 1997. The former chief executive of the American Trucking Associations, with his shock of white hair and   demeanor, Mr. Donohue, 77, morphed the chamber into a political lobbying machine with revenue topping $200 million, according to its 2014 tax filings. The chamber says it does not get involved in presidential elections, and that is mostly true. The Center for Responsive Politics shows relatively small donations given to Republican presidential candidates over the years. In 2012, Mr. Romney was the largest recipient, taking in $36, 900, according to data compiled by the center. A spokeswoman for the chamber said any donations to presidential candidates came from individuals in the chamber, rather than the chamber itself. A spokeswoman for the Center for Responsive Politics said its data typically includes donations from company executives because they have the resources to donate and usually do so for business reasons. While the vast majority of the chamber’s huge cash stockpile goes to its lobbying efforts  —   $124 million in 2014  —   another sizable slice goes to outside advertising. In the midterm elections in 2014, the chamber spent $35 million, overwhelmingly supporting Republican candidates. So far this year, it has spent nearly $14 million, none in support of Democrats. But to Mr. Trump’s point, the chamber does not publicly describe how it makes decisions regarding what policies or politicians to support. Inside the chamber is a bit murky. Its board is a mix of   leaders, trade associations and executives from large corporations, including IBM, Caterpillar, Phillips 66, Dow Chemical Company and Allstate Insurance. But over all, the chamber does not make its membership public. A search of tax records for donations to the chamber shows that while it has received significant donations from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the foundation set up by the billionaire investor Steven A. Cohen, some of its biggest contributions have come from the types of conservative political action committees that Mr. Trump likes to target. Crossroads GPS, the PAC founded by Karl Rove, gave $5. 2 million to the chamber while Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, the PAC founded by the Koch brothers, gave $2 million, according to 2014 tax filings, the most recent that were available. In an email, a spokeswoman for the chamber responded to a query by noting that the chamber has a “$250 million operation that represents American businesses of all sizes from across the country. ” When not tackling Mr. Trump on trade, the chamber is throwing its considerable political muscle and money behind Republican candidates in critical congressional races who share its ideology on free trade. Those candidates include Senator Rob Portman, who is fighting for   in the battleground state of Ohio. Before he entered the Senate, Mr. Portman was the United States trade representative for former President George W. Bush, where he supported the Central American Free Trade Agreement. Yet Republican strategists are curious how the gap between Mr. Trump and traditional conservatives over trade and other major themes will play out in the coming months. “Basically, Trump has a position on trade that no one who has ever been a nominee of any party has ever had  —   a 45 percent tariff on goods,” Mr. Stevens, the Romney strategist, said. “How is that going to work where you have joint efforts between the presidential campaign and the state parties with candidates who want free trade? Are you going to have half the phone bank calling for a 45 percent tariff, and the other half calling for reasonable trade policies?”"

The United States last month transferred two inmates from the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Serbia.

His stop in Kosovo underscored Western concern over the slow pace of progress 16 years after a U.S.-led NATO air war set the former Serbian province on the road to independence. Kosovo, a mainly Muslim but secular and staunchly pro-American country, declared independence in 2008. "

text="U.S. intelligence agencies feud with Republicans over Russian hacking Republican members of Congress are complaining that U.S. intelligence agencies are refusing to brief them widely on a classified CIA report that concluded Russia hacked Democratic Party data in an effort to help Donald Trump win the presidency. The Republicans said Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has refused their requests for full briefings of Congress’ two intelligence committees. U.S. government officials said the leaders of Congress and the chairmen of the two intelligence committees, known as the “Gang of Eight,” have been briefed on the Central Intelligence Agency’s conclusion. Nevertheless, Representative Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee and is a member of President-elect Trump’s transition team as well as the Gang of Eight, has called for a briefing for his entire committee on the CIA assessment. “The committee is vigorously looking into reports of cyber-attacks during the election campaign, and in particular we want to clarify press reports that the CIA has a new assessment that it has not shared with us,” Nunes said.Representative Ron Johnson, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said his panel also has asked for a briefing but the CIA refused. “It is disappointing that the CIA would provide information on this issue to the Washington Post and NBC but will not provide information to elected members of Congress,” Johnson said in a statement on Friday. Three U.S. government sources, who all asked for anonymity to discuss classified information, told Reuters that while the full congressional committees have not been briefed, the congressional leadership has, which is the standard procedure for briefing Congress on sensitive intelligence. The sources said that Nunes was personally briefed on the CIA finding. A congressional official denied Nunes was briefed, however. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement that because President Barack Obama last week ordered the intelligence community to conduct a full-scale “review of foreign efforts to influence recent presidential elections – from 2008 to the present,” the agencies would not comment further until the study is completed. ODNI, which oversees all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, said that when the review is complete, the U.S. intelligence community “stands ready to brief Congress.” The office said it also would make the study “available to the public consistent with protecting intelligence sources and methods.” The CIA based its conclusion about Russia hacking to influence the election not on irrefutable evidence but largely on its analysis of the fact that the Russians hacked both political parties while only publicizing information damaging to Democrats and their presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, said a U.S. official familiar with the agency’s work, who also requested anonymity. Two of the government sources said on Friday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation now backs the CIA assessment that the Russian hacks were aimed at helping Trump win. The ODNI also agrees with the assessment, all three government sources said. There was no immediate comment from the FBI. The FBI, which has responsibility for counterintelligence investigations inside the United States, initially did not endorse the CIA’s finding because it did not meet the standards of evidence necessary to win a conviction in a U.S. court or identify individuals whose hacking violated American law, one source said.The debate over Russian hacking also is opening a rift between Trump and some Republican members of Congress. The president-elect continues to dismiss the intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin directed the hacking. On Friday, Senator Richard Burr, Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, announced his committee will conduct a review in the new year of U.S. intelligence on Russian activities and its cyber activity more broadly. The review will include questioning of both Obama and Trump officials, “including the issuance of subpoenas if necessary to compel testimony,” Burr said in a statement. "

text="Police arrest woman in Tanzania over video of same-sex kiss DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Police in Tanzania have arrested a woman after a video clip showing her kissing and embracing another woman at a party was widely shared online, a senior official said. Homosexuality is a criminal offense in the East African nation, where a conviction for having  carnal knowledge of any person against the order of nature  can carry a life sentence. The woman, who police said resides in the northwestern Tanzanian town of Geita, was arrested after a video circulated on social media showing a woman kissing and hugging another woman and presenting her with a ring.  I can confirm that a Tanzanian woman is under police custody over that video clip. We will issue more details later after we conclude our investigation,  Geita police chief Mponjoli Mwabulambo told Reuters by telephone on Saturday. Tanzanian president John Magufuli s government has stepped up a crackdown against homosexuality since coming into power in 2015 and threatened in June to arrest and expel activists, as well as deregister all non-governmental organizations that campaign for gay rights. In October, authorities in the main city Dar es Salaam raided a meeting at a hotel, saying the gathering was promoting same-sex relationships, and arrested at least 12 men.  The arrest of the woman in Geita was thought to be the first arrest of a lesbian suspect in the recent crackdown and  police sources said authorities were also searching for the woman who was given the ring in the video clip. Reuters could not confirm where or when the video the filmed. The clip drew condemnation on social media platforms in the socially conservative nation, with some Tanzanians condemning the celebration as immoral.  Both of them should be arrested. Why did the woman accept an engagement ring from another woman?  Cosmas Alele, a resident of the northwestern town of Kagera said on Twitter, writing in Kiswahili. Since homosexuality is a criminal offense in Tanzania, rights groups are reluctant to speak publicly in defense of gay rights. The country s health ministry banned non governmental organizations last year from distributing free lubricants to gays as part HIV/AIDS control measures. Some health experts warn that shutting down HIV/AIDS outreach programs targeting gay people could put the wider population at higher risk of infections.  Around 1.4 million Tanzanians among a population of more than 50 million are living with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, according to government estimates.   "

text="Bill Nunn, Who Played Radio Raheem in ‘Do the Right Thing,’ Dies at 63 - The New York Times Bill Nunn, a versatile actor best known for playing the role of Radio Raheem, the   neighborhood philosopher killed by police officers in Spike Lee’s 1989 film “Do the Right Thing,” died on Saturday in Pittsburgh. He was 63. His death was announced on social media by Mr. Lee. His wife, Donna, told The Associated Press that Mr. Nunn had cancer. The first major acting role for Mr. Nunn, the son of a   professional football scout, was in the 1988 film “School Daze,” also written and directed by Mr. Lee. The next year brought the critically acclaimed “Do the Right Thing,” in which he played Radio Raheem, who carries a boombox blaring Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power” through the streets of the   area of Brooklyn on the hottest day of summer. Radio Raheem sits at the moral heart of the film, delivering a soliloquy directly to the camera on the ceaseless contest between love and hate, symbolized by the   rings he wears on each hand. The character’s choking death at the hands of police officers in front of a crowd of his neighbors incites the film’s wrenching final scenes. Mr. Nunn became a popular character actor after “Do the Right Thing” and appeared in a variety of films, including “New Jack City,” “Sister Act” and the “ ” trilogy by the director Sam Raimi. In 2004 he appeared in a Broadway revival of “Raisin in the Sun” as Bobo, alongside Audra McDonald, Phylicia Rashad and Sean Combs. But it was his performance as Radio Raheem that allowed him to make his greatest mark, Mr. Nunn said in an interview with ABC News to mark the 25th anniversary of the film’s release. He was a frequent collaborator of Mr. Lee and also appeared in his films “Mo’ Better Blues” and “He Got Game. ” Mr. Lee referred to him on Saturday as ”my dear friend, my dear Morehouse brother. ” They both attended Morehouse College in Atlanta. William Goldwyn Nunn III was born on Oct. 20, 1952, in Pittsburgh. His father was Bill Nunn, a scout for the Pittsburgh Steelers who helped build a football powerhouse in the 1970s by recruiting from the   football programs at historically black colleges and universities. He died in 2014. Mr. Lee memorialized Mr. Nunn in a series of social media posts on Saturday, sharing the text of his “Do the Right Thing” soliloquy as well as pictures of him as Radio Raheem. On social media, Mr. Lee cited the death of Eric Garner, who died after an officer placed him in a chokehold on Staten Island in 2014, as evidence of the continuing resonance of Radio Raheem’s violent death. In an interview with ABC News in 2014, Mr. Nunn reflected on the death of Mr. Garner, which was captured on video and helped propel a nationwide debate on the treatment of black men by the police. Much like the character that brought him to fame, Mr. Nunn focused on the need for love. “You know you’re watching a guy lose his life,” Mr. Nunn said in the interview. “For me, I’m just getting a little tired of watching these mothers on television, these poor mothers grieving their sons and children. It makes me wonder sometimes about where the compassion is. ”"

text="Trump names Eric Hargan as acting Health Secretary (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has appointed Eric Hargan as acting Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the White House said on Tuesday. Hargan, the deputy secretary of HHS, formerly served on Trump’s transition team for HHS. The appointment follows Tom Price’s resignation as HHS Secretary late in September over his use of costly private charter planes for government business. U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, considered a potential successor to Price, said on Tuesday he believed he could best serve the Trump administration in his current role.

text="The Woman Who ‘Totally Understands’ Donald Trump - The New York Times An inspirational poster hangs above the Trump Tower desk of Hope Hicks, the    press secretary for Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign, squeezed in among the framed Time magazine covers of Mr. Trump and exuberant   notes written in his inimitable scrawl (“Hopie  —   You’re the greatest! ”). “Fate whispers to the warrior, ‘You cannot withstand the storm,’” it reads. “And the warrior whispers back, ‘I am the storm. ’” Ms. Hicks, a onetime champion lacrosse player who signed a Ford modeling contract as a teenager, had never worked in politics before last year, and her widest exposure had been as a   in a Nickelodeon children’s television special about golf. Now she plays confidante and sometime gatekeeper to the presumptive Republican nominee for president and, improbably, serves as Mr. Trump’s sole liaison to the teeming national press corps. Hillary Clinton employs a     media handlers who field hundreds of daily requests. Mr. Trump has Ms. Hicks, who was working for his daughter Ivanka’s luxury lines and for the Trump real estate brand when the candidate called her to his office in early 2015 and declared that she was joining his campaign. “Mr. Trump sat her down and said, ‘This is your new job,’” said her mother, Caye Cavender Hicks. “It was a shocker. ” Hope Hicks had trained at Hiltzik Strategies, the powerful public relations firm that represents Hollywood clients and corporate executives, before Ms. Trump brought her  . She was commuting from an apartment she shared with her sister in Greenwich, Conn. above the dive bar where her father had his first beer at 18. Suddenly, she found herself a   presence by Mr. Trump’s side, flying in his jet, living   in a   apartment and attending to his mercurial moods. She is arguably the least credentialed press secretary in the modern history of presidential politics. But for journalists who cover the campaign, she is sometimes the Jekyll to Mr. Trump’s Hyde, emailing angry complaints from her   boss (“dishonest”) and often concluding with her own polite  : “Best, Hope. ” Seemingly unfazed by her boss’s outbursts, she can detect the best moments for reporters to make requests  —   knowing, for instance, not to bother Mr. Trump while he is watching a major golf tournament. “Her most important role is her bond with the candidate,” said Paul Manafort, the veteran Republican adviser who, as of this past week, had been put in charge of the campaign. “She totally understands him. ” Or, as Ivanka Trump said in an interview: “My father makes people earn his trust. She’s earned his trust. ” And not without some steeliness. Ms. Hicks remained in her role even as Mr. Trump fired Corey Lewandowski, his campaign manager and another early member of his team. Mr. Lewandowski and Ms. Hicks are close friends: He has visited her family in Greenwich for    dinners and, days after Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination (and fired a key political aide) they took in a Hall  Oates concert with her parents in the V. I. P. tent at the Greenwich Town Party. But it was ultimately Ms. Hicks who announced Mr. Lewandowski’s departure, describing it as “a parting of ways. ” Friends of Ms. Hicks say they are thrilled by her sudden rise, dismissing concerns that her ties to Mr. Trump could damage her nascent career. “She believes in him, his leadership and abilities, and she’s thrown herself completely into this,” said Michael Feldman, a prominent Democratic strategist and family friend. “I don’t think that ties her personally to everything that’s been said. ” But some say they are alarmed that Ms. Hicks is promoting, and defending, a candidate who has been denounced as a demagogue, a racist, a misogynist and even a fascist. In Greenwich, where her family is part of the civic firmament, the topic of her association with Mr. Trump can get touchy. “Believe me, there are times when I would like to voice my opinion,” said Drew Marzullo, a Greenwich town selectman and Democrat who is close with Ms. Hicks’s sister, Mary Grace. He recalled doing a double take after spotting Mr. Lewandowski and other Trump aides with the family at the Hall  Oates concert. Still, he added, “It would be unfair for someone to judge Hope or the family based on her job. ” In fact, Ms. Hicks is the third generation of her family to represent a powerful but highly controversial client. Her grandfather led public relations for Texaco during the 1970s oil crisis. Her father, Paul B. Hicks III, represented a major tobacco company in Connecticut and later was the top communications executive for the National Football League, where he dealt with scandals over player safety and the Patriots’ deflated footballs. Her establishment pedigree aside, Ms. Hicks does not fit the part of the typical campaign press secretary, spinning reporters and gossiping over expensed drinks on the trail. Among journalists, Ms. Hicks is not known to wrangle, cajole or mingle, serving as more of a conduit for her intensely   boss, who likes to act as his own chief spokesman. Unlike her Clinton counterparts, who take pains to shape their candidate’s image, Ms. Hicks is not active on Twitter and does not show up on cable talk shows. Contacted for this article, she declined to be interviewed, insisting that she did not want to draw attention away from her candidate. Reporters praise Ms. Hicks for her poise amid a chaotic campaign. But some say that she can be unresponsive to questions, a habit so pervasive that it spawned a mocking, anonymous Twitter account, @HicksNoComment. On the trail, political reporters say Ms. Hicks rarely interacts with them at rallies, preferring to communicate by text or telephone. Ms. Hicks  —   perhaps the only campaign press secretary to have been photographed as a teenager by the fashion photographer Bruce Weber, in a campaign for Naturalizer shoes  —   favors Burberry trench coats and heels, a break from the scruffy ranks of harried campaign operatives. One reporter recalled staggering into a New Hampshire rally after a snowstorm, soaked in water and ice, only to find Ms. Hicks dressed impeccably, her makeup unmussed. Still, the stresses of the campaign have occasionally spilled into public view: Despite their friendship, Ms. Hicks and Mr. Lewandowski were spotted in a screaming match on a Manhattan sidewalk, which later turned up in The New York Post, fueling reports of internal tensions. Mostly, however, Ms. Hicks is a friendly, if disciplined, presence  —   Southern charm by way of Fairfield County. (Upon accompanying Mr. Trump to Scotland this past week, she told a reporter wryly, “I don’t do well in plaid. ”) And she is unfailingly deferential to her employer, whom she refers to only as “Mr. Trump” or “sir. ” He seems to appreciate it. “I’m lucky to have her,” Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview on Thursday. “She’s got very good judgment. She will often give advice, and she’ll do it in a very   manner, so it doesn’t necessarily come in the form of advice. But it’s delivered very nicely. ” Did he have qualms about hiring a campaign spokeswoman with no political background? “Well, I have a lot of political experience, so I wasn’t really concerned about it,” Mr. Trump said. “And if it didn’t work out, I would be able to make a fast change,” he said. “But it has worked out. ” Mr. Trump sent flowers to Ms. Hicks’s family when her grandmother died earlier this year. Her parents also visited    Mr. Trump’s Florida resort, where he greeted them and teased Mr. Hicks about the N. F. L. “He could not have been nicer,” Caye Hicks said. Ms. Hicks’s success has not surprised her family (“Hope’s a fighter,” as her father said) even as they harbor some concern about the intensity of her work. “She doesn’t really talk to anybody anymore, she has no life,” Caye Hicks said. Mr. Trump’s rallies, where violent protests sometimes break out, can also be disconcerting. “I have to hope the Secret Service is keeping them all safe,” Caye Hicks said. “It’s a crazy atmosphere. ” She added: “I can’t actually let her know how worried I am. ” On free nights, Ms. Hicks retreats to her parents’ home in Greenwich  —   her mother sometimes hears a creaking door at 2 a. m.  —   to unwind. Her sister, Mary Grace, is a paramedic there, and her father, a former town selectman, remains a prominent figure: This spring, Greenwich proclaimed April 23 as Paul B. Hicks III Day to recognize his philanthropy. Ms. Hicks grew up in Greenwich swimming and golfing. When she was in sixth grade, a neighbor invited Ms. Hicks and her sister to a Ralph Lauren tryout soon their photographs were in Bloomingdale’s. She made a cameo on “Guiding Light,” appeared on the covers of young adult paperbacks like “Gossip Girl” and once read lines for a film role with Alec Baldwin. At age 13, Ms. Hicks told Greenwich Magazine, for a cover story about the Hicks sisters’ modeling careers, that she was “not ready to decide if modeling is what I want to do with my life. ” “If the acting thing doesn’t work out,” she said, “I could really see myself in politics. Who knows?” The Hicks sisters earned enough from modeling to file tax returns. But Hope preferred lacrosse, leading Greenwich High School to a state championship and later playing at Southern Methodist University, where she majored in English. After graduation, she and her father bumped into Mr. Baldwin at the Super Bowl. The meeting led to an interview and job offer from Matthew Hiltzik, whose clients include Mr. Baldwin and, fatefully, Ivanka Trump, who was impressed by Ms. Hicks and eventually hired her away. Aside from Mr. Trump’s children, Ms. Hicks is now the   aide on his presidential bid. Mr. Feldman, the family friend, said he doubted that anyone anticipated it would last this long. “You do the best you can under very unusual circumstances,” he said. “In this case, circumstances that are more unusual than most. ” The campaign is looking to hire a communications director. But as the general election looms, Ms. Hicks, who has recently been featured in Marie Claire and GQ, remains loyal, apparently unperturbed by the controversies swirling around her candidate and prepared to stick it out. Mr. Trump, asked if Ms. Hicks would have a spot in his administration, replied, “She would definitely have a role. ” How about press secretary? “I don’t want to comment on that,” he said. “It’s too early. I don’t want to be making those prognostications yet. But she’ll certainly be involved with us. She’s terrific. ”"
